# IE0005 Project Work

Our team chose to tackle the problem regarding cardio vascular disease (CVD) dataset, from kaggle. <br>

Our objective was to determine what were the key features/factors that led to CVD. <br>
From our analysis, we discovered that using <b> BMI, Weight, ap_hi, ap_lo, age and MAP </b>, we are able to predict with an accuracy of over 60%
whether a person will suffer from CVD.

To test out and see, please run file name: " IE0005_EL24_G5_submission.ipynb " <br>
To further understand why we did some steps, you can view " IE0005_EL_G5_submission.ppt "
